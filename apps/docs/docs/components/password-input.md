##  Summary

In this example, we created a secure **Password** input field using `formik-form-builder`.  
It includes required field validation and a strong regex pattern to enforce secure password rules  
(uppercase, lowercase, number, special character, and at least 6 characters).

We also used `muiProps.type = password` to mask the input.
