[Autocomplete](/docs/category/autocomplete) is a text input enhanced by a panel of suggested options when users start typing.

## Introduction

`Autocomplete` is an enhanced version of text input that shows suggested options as the users type and also let them select an option from the list. It enables users to quickly find and select from a pre-populated list of values as they type, leveraging searching and filtering.

### Usage

To use a MultiText field, set the type to `InputTypes.AUTO_COMPLETE`.
Check [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/my-doc-configuration#fieldtype-structure) to see what we can pass.

Examples have been provided in the next pages of how we can use Autocomplete using `formik-form-builder`.
