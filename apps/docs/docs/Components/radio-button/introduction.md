[Radio](/docs/category/radio-button) buttons enable the user to select one option from a set.

## Introduction

`Radio` buttons let users make a mutually exclusive choice (for example: "this" or "that"). Only one selection is allowed from the available set of options. Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected. Radio buttons should have the most commonly used option selected by default.

### Usage

To use a MultiText field, set the type to `InputTypes.RADIO`.
We can make it a variant of either 	`"DEFAULT"` or `"ICON"`
Check [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/my-doc-configuration#fieldtype-structure) to see what we can pass.

Examples have been provided in the next pages of how we can use radio button using `formik-form-builder`.
