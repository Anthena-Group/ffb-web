[Checkbox](/docs/category/checkbox) give users binary choices when presented with multiple options in a series.

## Introduction
`Checkbox` provide users with a graphical representation of a binary choice (yes or no, on or off, etc). We have created ways to handle checkbox operations using `formik-form-builder`.

### Usage

To make it a checkbox, use type: `InputTypes.CHECKBOX`. Check [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/my-doc-configuration#fieldtype-structure) to see what we can pass.

Examples have been provided in the next pages of how we can use checkbox using `formik-form-builder`.
