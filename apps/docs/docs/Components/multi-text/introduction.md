[MultiText](/docs/category/multitext) allows users to enter longer, multi-line responses in a form.

## Introduction

`MultiText` field is used to capture extended, multi-line input such as descriptions, comments, feedback, or detailed notes. It offers a spacious input area that supports line breaks, making it more comfortable for writing longer responses. This makes it ideal for open-ended questions, detailed explanations, or any situation where users need space to express themselves clearly and thoroughly.

### Usage

To use a MultiText field, set the type to `InputTypes.MULTI_TEXT`.
Check [Configuration](/docs/getting-started/my-doc-configuration#fieldtype-structure) to see what we can pass.

Examples have been provided in the next pages of how we can use MultiText using `formik-form-builder`.
